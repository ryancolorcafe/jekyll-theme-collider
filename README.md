## About
This theme has two main nifty features, the use of [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and the [jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/tree/master/examples). For those who don't know, the jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin allows you to do cool things like paginate within a given collection, which the current jekyll-paginate gem does not allow.

I'm also using the powers of [ITCSS](https://github.com/ahmadajmi/awesome-itcss) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) in an attempt to keep the SCSS as clean as possible. You may also notice that I'm trying to avoid the use of any libraries to keep things nice and simple. This also allows for greater learning opportunities.

The font I'm using is a favorite of mine, Watford. Also notice the fun use of colors on tags and each page, these are easily customizable by design and is detailed below.

## Installation
#### Jekyll requirements
* You must have Ruby installed:
    * https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
* Install Jekyll and Bundler:
    * `gem install jekyll bundler`

#### Create a local copy of the site
* Download this site:
    * `git clone https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider.git`
* Move into directory:
    * `cd jekyll-theme-collider`
* Install required gems:
    * `bundle install`
* Verify it's working:
    * `bundle exec jekyll serve`
    * Browse to http://localhost:4000

#### Install theme using gem
* Add this line to your Gemfile:
    * `gem "jekyll-theme-collider"`
* Install running this command in your terminal:
    * `bundle install`
* Remove the default index.md and about.md files:
    * `rm index.md about.md`
* Download the index.md file:
    * `curl -L -O "https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider/raw/master/index.md"`
* Create the necÂ·essary folders:
    * `mkdir _blog_posts _blog_tags pages tags`
* Download pages files:
    * `cd pages && curl -L -O "https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider/raw/master/pages/{about.html,blog.html,contact.html,thanks.html}"`


* While not necessary to download the following, you may want to in order to see an example of the use of tags, and to have enough posts to see the jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin in action. Run each command one at a time:
  * `cd ../tags && curl -L -O "https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider/raw/master/tags/{nonprofit.md,painting.md}"`

  * `cd ../_blog_tags && curl -L -O "https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider/raw/master/_blog_tags/{nonprofit.md,painting.md}"`

  * `cd ../_blog_posts && curl -L -O "https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider/raw/master/_blog_posts/{2015-08-15-transition-projects.md,2016-09-30-disjecta.md,2016-10-27-the-nature-conservancy.md,2017-09-27-nice-little-clouds.md,2017-11-10-caldera-arts.md,2018-02-10-the-nature-conservancy.md,2018-07-11-happy-little-trees.md}"`

* Don't forget to go back to the root directory `cd ..`

* Finally, add the following to config.yml:

```
title: [Your site title here]
email: [Your email]
description: >
  [Your site description]
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://jekyll-theme-collider.netlify.com"  # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
github_username: [Your GitHub user name]
linked_in_profile: [LinkedIn profile url]
full_name: [Your username]
user_description: [Your description]
disqus:
  shortname: [Your Disqus shortname] # https://disqus.com

theme: jekyll-theme-collider

plugins:
  - jekyll-paginate-v2

collections:
  blog_posts:
    output: true
    permalink: /collection/:name
  blog_tags:

pagination:
  enabled: true
  per_page: 3
  permalink: '/:num/'
  title: ':title'
  limit: 0
  sort_field: 'date'
  sort_reverse: true
  collection: 'blog_posts'
  trail:
    before: 2
    after: 2
```

* Run your server and you should be good to go!  
  * `bundle exec jekyll serve`

#### Troubleshooting:
* The `curl -L -O` commands may not have fully downloaded each file. Even if it seems the file was fully downloaded, open each one to make sure that it doesn't just contain a 503 error inside. Delete the files with errors and retry the curl commands.  
* You may need to restart your server in order for your changes to take effect.

## Tags

To create a new tag, make a new file in the `tags` directory with the name of the tag you'd like to use. The structure of each is the following:

```
---
layout: blog
title: Jekyll
permalink: /jekyll
color: purple
pagination:
  enabled: true
  collection: all
  tag: jekyll
---

All posts tagged with _Jekyll_
```
If you're familiar with Jekyll [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), this configuration will be intuitive. The parts unique to this theme are the color and the pagination configurations. The color configured here will determine the color of the tag page header and is based on SCSS color settings, meaning it's not just the default CSS purple color being used here. More on that in the colors section below.

The pagination settings are necessary to set for the jekyll-pagination-v2 plugin. The only one you'll likely want to ever modify here is the `tag:` setting, where you simply put the tag name you'd like to use in lowercase.

You'll also want to create a new file in the `_blog_tags` directory that is also named after the tag you'd like to use. This is to set the color of the actual tags themselves, and only the color needs to be set as below:
```
---
color: purple
---
```
In order to configure the colors as above, and make your own custom colors, see the section on colors below.

## Colors

If using this theme as a gem, see [overriding theme defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) in the Jekyll docs as you will need to make a copy of the following files.

#### Page header colors

To set up a new color variable in the SCSS, you may do so in `settings/_color.scss`. To create a new reusable color class that can be used for tag pages and the tags themselves, go to `elements/_colors.scss`. The structure a new color classes should look like the following:

```
.orange {
  color: $channel-orange;
  &.icon {
    fill: $channel-orange;
  }
}

.bg--orange {
  background: $channel-orange;
  color: $white;
}

a.bg--orange:hover {
  background: darken($channel-orange, $darken--button);
}
```

This is what would allow you to simply configure `color: orange` in your `tags` and `_blog_tags` directory files. For an example of what is happening under the hood, you can take a look at the `_includes/header.html` file, lines 1-15.

#### Homepage background color

To change the background color of the particles.js canvas on the homepage, go to `components/_particles.scss` and change the background color here:
```
#particles-js {
  background: $dark-sea-green;
}
```

## About page customization

If creating a local copy of the site, simple modify the HTML and text in `_layouts/about.html`. When using the gem theme, create a new `_layouts` directory with an `about.html` file inside that use the following front matter:
```
---
layout: default
---
```
You may put whatever HTML and text you'd like below.

## Customizing particles js

To customize particles.js, such as the shape and size of the particles, you'll need to edit `assets/js/app.js`. If using the theme gem, you'll need to create this file and override with your own settings. Since this customization is outside the scope of this readme, I recommend learning more on the particles.js [GitHub page](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).

## Future projects

* A portfolio/work page using CSS Grid  
* Search bar for articles in blog  
* Modular scale typography
