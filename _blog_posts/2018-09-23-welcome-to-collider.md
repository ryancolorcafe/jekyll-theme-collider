Welcome to the Collider Jekyll theme! This is a demo site for the [jekyll-theme-collider](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-collider) gem. All other articles here are lorem ipsum and are there to display the use of pagination.

This theme has two main nifty features, the use of [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and the [jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/tree/master/examples). I find the latter may be of most use for people as I personally haven't come across a lot of examples of Jekyll sites using this plugin. For those who don't know, the jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin allows you to do cool things like paginate within a given collection, which the current jekyll-paginate gem does not allow.

I'm also using the powers of [ITCSS](https://github.com/ahmadajmi/awesome-itcss) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) in an attempt to keep the SCSS as clean as possible. You may also notice that I'm trying to avoid the use of any libraries to keep things nice and simple. This also allows for greater learning opportunities.

The font I'm using is a favorite of mine, [Operator Mono SSm](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/operatormonoscreensmart). Also notice the fun use of colors with tags and on each page header. You can learn how to easily customize these in the [colors](https://github.com/ryancolorcafe/jekyll-theme-collider#colors) section in the README.

Here are some things I'd love to see in the future:  

  &nbsp;&nbsp;-> A portfolio/work page using CSS Grid  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Search bar for articles in the blog  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Modular Scale Typography  

Please feel free to [reach out](https://ryandevelops.com/contact) if you have any questions or ideas for additions to the theme. Hope you enjoy the Collider theme!
